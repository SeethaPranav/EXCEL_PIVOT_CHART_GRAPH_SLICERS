# EXCEL_PIVOT_CHART_GRAPH_SLICERS
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my progress through the #75DaysOfDataAnalysisChallenge as part of the #EntriElevate program. This repository showcases my journey in developing essential data analysis skills through practical projects.

Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning Techniques: Initial days focused on removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and applying conditional formatting to ensure data accuracy and enhance visualization.

Advanced Analysis: In later days, I explored Pivot Tables for efficient data summarization, created various charts and graphs to visualize insights, and implemented Slicers for interactive data filtering.

Skills Developed:
Data cleaning and preparation
Pivot Table creation and manipulation
Chart and graph development for effective data storytelling
Use of Slicers for improved data interactivity

Repository Contents:
Project files demonstrating each stage of the challenge
Code snippets and visualizations
Documentation outlining my process and learnings
